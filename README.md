# Face Match

Using **Python** and **face-recognition** project (https://pypi.org/project/face-recognition/) you can specify a photo from a face and then the script with find all the photos in a folder that have that face. The output is the filename(s) where the condition is met.

You must **install face_recognition** using pip for example (_pip install face_recognition_) and set the **face photo path** in _your_face_path = ""_ and the **folder** with all the photos where the script will try to find your face in _folder_path = ""_


**Examples** of where this can be useful: for example to find the photos where you appear from a **marathon**, **wedding**, **other events**, etc. set of photos.
